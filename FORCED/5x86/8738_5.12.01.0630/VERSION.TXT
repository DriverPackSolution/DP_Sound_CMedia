            should be disabled in Windows XP under the condition
            "EnableLegacy = 1 or 3".

============================================================================
0628 (Sensaura Library 2135)

STEP2.SYS : fix the problem that XP HCT failed on driver verifier, it is
            due to inappropriate processing on PnP IRP

            2. Add Microphone gain, range 0dB ~ 12dB. Set by the key, "MicAddGainDB",
               in INF file.

STEP9.SYS : 1. Add three volume node (LineIn_WaveIn, Aux_WaveIn, CD_WaveIn) and use port
               calss event to notify each other, if any change happens.

STEP10.SYS : 1. Correct the error in driver verifier. The handler of port calss event
                must be in non-paged memory.

             3. use new CMnprop.dll, which support interface "ICMAudioProperty2".

INF : modify INF as the INF of 0625b
============================================================================

============================================================================
0626 (Sensaura Library 2135)

STEP1.SYS : 1. Change the name PcSpeaker to MonoIn

STEP2.SYS : 1. Open External Bass
            2. modify pnp.cpp and pnp.h
============================================================================

0623 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. fix the power management problems with Sensaura

STEP2.SYS : 1. Add "ADAPTER_DIGITAL_SHARED"

0622 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. In "AdapterDispatchPower", when entering power state D3, we should
               CloseStreamManager. Otherwise, system will be crashed, because
               Sensaura rendering timer is still working.
            2. In case we go to any sleep state we disconnect the interrupt service
               reoutine from the interrupt.
            3. Delete "retard closing StreamManager". It has no use now.
            4. Solve the problem of "when Reverb is enabled and wave check box in
               MS volume control is muted, we still can hear the reverb sound".

STEP2.SYS : 1. In private property "KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_MISCELLANEOUS", "FuncLimited",
               and "CutMSSpeakerConfig" can be get and set.

STEP3.SYS : 1. Fix the problem in HCT wave driver "test case 9:36 sampling rate
               accuracy". When the WaveIn format is other than 44k/48k, we should
               fail that WaveIn capture in ValidateFormat. Then system will convert
               itself.
STEP4.SYS : 1. Correct the noise of MicAsCenterBass, when start and stop playing.
            2. Use Sensaura's new library to set 3dBBoost=TRUE, and take multiply
               coefficient 1.4 out.

STEP5.SYS : 1. When set to the maximum left or right pan in wave control of the
               Microsoft volume control, the front 2 speakers will all be muted.
               (In STEP1.SYS, point 4, we made some mistake)
            2. In step4, there is an eorror, "the LineInAsRear setting is not issued
               to CMI8738 at Windows start up" (only in step4). We correct this
               problem in step5.

0621 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. The full function chip, can be used as FuncLimited LX chip.
            2. When chip is FuncLimited, delete AC3-pin in WaveCyclicSB16.
            3. When use 44k rendering for SPDIFOUT, we must receive a 2 channels
               format from system, because the Sensaura library can't support
               channel mixing st this time. (if we un-check Reverb, and use MCI
               to play sound, the sound will be missing).
            4. Correct the errors in LinInAsRear, LineInAsBass, MicAsBass.
            5. In HCT test, retard closing StreamManager for 1 sec, if the sound
               rendering time is less than 1 sec.

               #define STREAM_MANAGER_DELAY_COUNT   400        // 1 unit = 2.5ms
               #define STREAM_MANAGER_DUE_TIME      (-10000000)// 1 unit = 100ns

STEP2.SYS : 1. The Matrox PCVCR problem: When recording is active, the rendering
               should switch to DSSPEAKER_QUAD, only when the dwSpeakerConfig is
               DSSPEAKER_5POINT1.

STEP3.SYS : 1. When we multiply a coefficient 1.3 to the Sensaura rendered data,
               the value may possibly overflow (> 32767 or < -32768), so we should
               do the saturation in the MMX code (This is a temporally solution).

STEP4.SYS : 1. When WinDVD play AC3 digital data, 039 chip use channels 1 to play,
               037 use channel 0 to play, so we should mute channels 0, and 1
               simultaneouly. Otherwise, noise will be heard. This solution can
               cover all chip version.

0620 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. After Sensaura rendering, multiply a coefficient 1.3 to increase
               the signal level for HCT test of Sensaura WDM driver.
            2. only Sensaura INF exists (HCTINF is cancelled).

               #define VOLUME_COEFF1                13
               #define VOLUME_COEFF2                20

STEP2.SYS : 1. In INF file, use "CutMSSpeakerConfig" to disconnect the speaker
               config from Microsoft control panel.

STEP3.SYS : 1. When judging FuncLimited, chip 055 is inversed.
            2. When chip is FuncLimited, ValidateFormat will fail the format,
               KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_DOLBY_AC3_SPDIF.

0619 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. PC Speaker mute
            2. Microphone recording gain control (Boost when recording)
            3. When playing a 6 channel wave during recording is active,
               inform Sensaura and switch to 4 speakers.
            4. In KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_MISCELLANEOUS property, add an item called,
               EnableSensaura, to save ADAPTER_USE_SENSAURA in registry.

STEP2.SYS : 1. In KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_SPDIF property, add an item called,
               SamplingRate, to select rendering SPDIF on 44k or 48k
            2. fix speaker geometry
            3. fix Microphone recording gain control (stored in HWMixerExtSettings)

STEP3.SYS : 1. fix the bug of "When recording is active, switch to 4 speakers"

0618 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. Use multiplex node and sum node to select recording source in topology.
               User can choose multiple sources in MS recording control
               (traditional 8738 way).
STEP2.SYS : 1. fix the problem that 037 chip 18H D24 cannot read correctly

0617 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. Use multiplex node to select recording source in topology
            2. "RecordMultiplex" in INF is used as the default selection (1-5)
                RecordMultiplex = 1 ---> Wave
                RecordMultiplex = 2 ---> Line In
                RecordMultiplex = 3 ---> Aux
                RecordMultiplex = 4 ---> CD
                RecordMultiplex = 5 ---> Microphone
                RecordMultiplex = 6 ---> All (Wave + LineIn + Aux + CD + Mic)
            3. KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_CHIP_INFO can get CMI33, CMI37, CMI39, CMI55

STEP2.SYS : 1. RecordMultiplex = 6 ---> decided by RecordSettings
            2. Add the following property, which is used to determine the
               private combined record-settings.
                   KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_RECORD_SELECT = 9;

0616 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. Solve the problem of MCI FALSE-Multi-Channel.
               Use "Enable-Reverb" to control MCI 2 or 6 channels
            2. Add the following properties
                   KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_CHIP_INFO = 6;
                   KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_CHANNEL_NUM = 7;
                   KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_PLAY_6CHAN = 8;
            3. Note that KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_PLAY_6CHAN can over-write
               "Enable-Reverb" in KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_GLOBAL_REVERB
            4. Disable ForceGenerateCenter/ForceCopyMode in property page


0615 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : Add a registry key, MasterVolAtten, which can cantrol the master volume
            Attenuation.
            MasterVolAtten's unit = dB, ex., 0x0001 = 1dB, 0x0002 = 2dB
